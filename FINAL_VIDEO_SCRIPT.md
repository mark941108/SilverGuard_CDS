## 🛠️ Google AI Studio Setup (System Instruction)

**Copy and paste this into the "System Instructions" block in Google AI Studio to set the persona:**

```text
You are an expert voiceover artist recording a narration for a tech competition video (Google Impact Challenge). 
Your voice is:
1.  **Professional & Authoritative:** Like a senior engineer explaining a critical system.
2.  **Clear & Articulate:** Every word must be distinct.
3.  **Paced:** slightly slower than conversation (0.9x speed) to allow for technical comprehension.
4.  **Empathetic:** When discussing patients, soften your tone.
5.  **Steady:** Maintain a consistent volume and rhythm.

**Pronunciation Rules:**
- "MedGemma": Pronounce as "Med-JEM-mah" (Soft G like 'Gem').
- "SigLIP": Pronounce as "Sig-Lip" (Soft G like 'Signal').
- "GPU": Pronounce as letters "G-P-U".
- "RAG": Pronounce as "Rag" (rhymes with Bag).
- "CDS": Pronounce as letters "C-D-S".

## 🎙️ Scene 1: The Hook (0:00 - 0:20)

**【複製到 Style instructions】(上方格子)**
> Speak in a serious, introspective tone. You are a senior engineer starting a presentation. Build tension. Pause slightly after "healthcare".

**【複製到 Text】(下方格子)**
```text
As an Energy Engineering student, I am trained to prevent system failures.
But in healthcare... errors can have serious consequences.
Existing OCR makes mistakes. Standard LLMs hallucinate.
This is SilverGuard C-D-S. A Clinical Decision Support prototype.
```

## 🎙️ Scene 2: Edge AI Solution (0:20 - 0:35)

**【複製到 Style instructions】(上方格子)**
> Speak in a confident, punchy, and technical tone. Emphasize the words "locally", "single", and "offline".

**【複製到 Text】(下方格子)**
```text
Unlike cloud-based solutions, our core inference runs locally on a single T-Four G-P-U.
Zero patient data leaves the device. 
Secure. Offline-capable. And cost-effective.
```

## 🎙️ Scene 3: Agentic Core (0:35 - 1:25)

**【複製到 Style instructions】(上方格子)**
> Speak in an analytical and dramatic tone. This is the most important technical part. Slow down when explaining the "Self-Correction Loop".

**【複製到 Text】(下方格子)**
```text
Watch closely. When the model reads a high dose for an 88-year-old patient...
It doesn't guess. The system catches the logical conflict.
It triggers a Self-Correction Loop. It injects error context into the prompt...
...and lowers its temperature from zero-point-six to zero-point-two to become deterministic.

We trade latency for safety. 
Because getting an answer three seconds late... is better than getting a wrong answer instantly.
```

## 🎙️ Scene 4: SilverGuard Impact (1:25 - 2:20)

**【複製到 Style instructions】(上方格子)**
> Shift your tone to be warm, empathetic, and human-centric. You are talking about grandmothers and caregivers.

**【複製到 Text】(下方格子)**
```text
Raw JSON is useless to a grandmother. 
SilverGuard translates safety alerts into large-font visuals.

But clarity isn't just for the elderly; it's for those who care for them.
Taiwan's two-hundred-fifty-thousand migrant caregivers now have safety alerts in their language.

Visual safety alerts. Ensuring care has no language barrier.
```

*(Note: Use the pre-generated Indonesian TTS file for the "MOHON TANYA APOTEKER" part)*

We are not replacing pharmacists.
